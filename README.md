🧠 How It Works

ML Model: Trained on academic data (age, CGPA, attendance, behavioral score, etc.)

Risk Prediction: Uses classification to determine dropout likelihood.

AI Insights: Uses Mistral via OpenRouter to give tailored academic advice.

Educator Chatbot: Teachers can ask academic questions for quick AI support.
