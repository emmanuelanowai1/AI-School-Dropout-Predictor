# 🎓 DropAlert NG – AI-Powered Student Dropout Predictor

An intelligent, data-driven tool that predicts student dropout risk and generates personalized AI insights — designed especially for schools and educators in Nigeria.

Built for the **3MTT Knowledge Showcase (July Edition)** to demonstrate how **AI + Data** can solve real educational problems in Nigeria.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Predict individual dropout risk using student data (CGPA, attendance, discipline, etc.)
- 📂 Upload Excel/CSV files for **bulk risk analysis**
- 🧠 Get **AI-generated intervention plans** for each student (powered by Mistral/OpenRouter)
- 📊 **Dropout risk meter** + smart warning labels (Low, Medium, High)
- 📥 Downloadable **Parent Report PDF**
- 💬 Chat with an **AI Academic Advisor** (Ask: “How can I help this student?”)
- 🎨 Enhanced UI with tabs, emojis, and icons
- 🧩 Easy deployment via Streamlit Cloud

---

## 🎯 How It Works

1. Collect or upload student academic and behavioral data.
2. Our trained ML model predicts the dropout likelihood.
3. The app displays a **Dropout Risk Score** and alert labels.
4. Mistral AI explains **why** the student is at risk and suggests what to do.
5. Lecturers/ Students can chat with the **AI Academic Advisor** for help.
6. Admins can download PDF reports for follow-up with parents/guardians.
